# Dungeon Mapper Android 
A Xamarin.Forms proof of concept application for reusing the code in the DungeonMapper2 repo for an Android app. It consumes the .Net Standard project from that repo
and allows for some basic functionality similar to that application. Currently it only supports one map being edited and saved, which is the view that the app starts to.

## Uncertain Future
Importing the code from the Dungeon Mapper Windows app did more or less work, however after toying around with Xamararin.Forms I came to the conclusion that I wasn't
really into the framework. Things like the top recomendation to create a line for a UI component being to make a 1 unit height box are a major red flag for a framework.
